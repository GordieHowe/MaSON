GeoJSON of George Mason University Fairfax campus.

The university hosts Esri Shapefiles of campus for student and faculty use [Library's Geo-data Server](http://librarygeodata.gmu.edu.mutex.gmu.edu/), however they are from 2010. With the amount of construction that takes place on campus every year, 6 years old is woefully out of date.

So, here's a (reasonably) up to date GeoJSON of campus buildings. `mason_fairfax_rawOSM` is the initial pull from OpenStreetMap and `mason_fairfax` is that data cleaned up according to the current campus static map and more recent aerial photography, with several new buildings added. Those updates are headed for OSM as well.

##### To do:

- Can add roads and walkways, as well as any additional features.

- Keep up to date with current campus construction.
