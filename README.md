GeoJSON of George Mason University Fairfax campus.

The university hosts Esri Shapefiles of campus for student and faculty use [Library's Geo-data Server](http://librarygeodata.gmu.edu.mutex.gmu.edu/), however they are from 2010. With the amount of construction that takes place on campus every year, 5 years old is woefully out of date.

So, here's an up to date GeoJSON of campus buildings, extracted from OSM, cleaned up, with some additional information.

##### To do:

- Can add roads and walk ways, as well as any additional features.

- Keep up to date with current campus construction.
